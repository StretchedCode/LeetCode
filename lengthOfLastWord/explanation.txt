This question asks that given an input string with only english characters and spaces present within it, return the length of the last word within the string.

The challenges created by this question are as follows:

1. How do I know if the string is a word?

2. How do I know if the word is the final one within the string?

To Answer 1., We can simply parse through the string, ignoring every instance of when the substring of length 1 equates to the " " string. However, when the 
substring of length 1 does NOT equate to the space string, we consider it as the beginning of a word, and add it to the count variable, which representes the length
of the word. 

2. We can remove the entire portion of determining whether or not if the word whose length is being counted is the last word by beginning the loop iteration from the end.
This refers to starting the loop from the last index i = s.length(). With this method, the first instance of non-space characters will represent the last word of the string.
Additionally, once the substring of length 1 after the previous substring returns a space string, it defines the end of the word and exits the loop. 

Constraints and errors:

1. The main source of errors within this solution would arise from improper use of indexing the string. Particularly attempting to create a substring with negative indices
would cause a OutOfBounds error to throw. This would occur whenever the difference of i - 2 < 0 and whenever the length of the string would be 1.

    - These are the edge scenarios that needed to be taken into account, with the loop breaking whenever one of these conditions were satisfied.
